# ManimCustom
This repository contains the source code for the video of the project we've done
for the University of Paris-Saclay.

We had to present a subject related to science applied in the field of arts. So we studied
the subject of "IR-Spectroscopy" and so we wanted to create a video that would explain the basics of this field.

To render the video, we used the [Manim](https://www.manim.community/) library and every underlying library
(like [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/), [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org/)).

# Instructions
In case you want to render yourself this video, you can use the following command:
> manim -pqh main.py [SceneToRender]
